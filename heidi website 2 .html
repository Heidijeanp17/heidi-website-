<h1 <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Person I Care About Is My Mom</h1>  </h1>
<p style="background-color:rgb(162, 22, 255);">My mom is the woman that brought me into this world, she also been there for me since birth. My mother is a real definition of a "mom". When i need a shoulder to cry on she is on of the first people that i will go to. She is my bestfriend and we tell each other everything
  Without my mom i would not be the woman that i am today. she taught me how to cook, clean, dance, talk, do my own make-up, taught me how to dress,clean the house, and most importanly be femine.  
  Her way of demonstrating compassion is very unique. She always puts herself in everyone else's shoes, without naming their flaws. Overall, she the best mother I could have asked for. </p> </p>
</p>
<p <p style="background-color:tomato;"> Things that mom do that makes me happy is when she cooks, do does hair, take me shopping. My Mom usually cooks alot of haitain food at home and one of my favorite meals from her is called "soupfey with Goat", "haitain sphagetti".  I am really greatful to have a mother because some people do not have the opportunity to spend time with my mom. For all the hard work that she put in taking care of me for 21 years i will gift her with a huge 7 bed room 7 bathroom town house one day. 
  "A mother is your first friend, your best friend, your forever friend <mark>  </p>.
